### dimensional-fft-tools
Tools for one-dimensional fft operations on multidimensional datasets in MATLAB.

A part of this toolbox - dfun is already published as an independent function [on Mathworks](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/63686-dfun). I will maintain it there as a latest stable release. This repository will have the bleeding-edge version in it.

#### ToDo's
 - Go through all the WIP and put them into this list
